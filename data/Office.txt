<>I've been very disappointed with this app.
<>Existing document layout is not always faithfully rendered.
<>Formatting options are extremely limited when starting from scratch and cumbersome to get to (it's easier to simply keep typing in an existing already formatted document).
<>And why is it not made available for tablets where it would be more comfortable to use?
<>I especially dislike the "wobbling" effect when moving around a document.
