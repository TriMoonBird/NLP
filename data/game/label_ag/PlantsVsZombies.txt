Title: Fix the glitch plz
Review: 
<p>Endless zone glitch in recent update causes you to not get plants after level 1. Also trying to exit will cause a loop that brings you back to the start of the level you were on, even if you lose, causing me to force close the app.
<p>Not sure if any other parts of the game only tried pirate seas.
<o>Note: I like how people are telling you guys about this glitch and the only thing you guys have done so far is raise the price of the dandelion.
<o>Dont you guys ever reply to the reviews on here.

Review: 
<p>You guys need to fix the game ASAP,  there are a  lot of glitches going on, for example in endless mode, you don't have the option to pick out a plant and when you try to "ritire" it keeps taking you back to the game!!!
<p>I love this game but now is  a hassle to play, not to mention that i had to start all over again because it froze on me and i had to uninstall an reinstall, please fix!!

Title: Horrible money grab
Review: 
<s>Simply put don't download this game.
<s>You have to pay individually for each new plant after the first 6 or so.
<s>This includes more than half of the plants that you got by simply progressing through the first game.
<s>I've never been more disappointed in a sequel before as this is sheet lunacy.
<s>It would cost upwards of $75-$100 to be able top use every plant.
<s>Have not and will not ever spend a dime on this company as a result, absolutely disgusting.

<s>As is the unfortunate trend in many games now, you have to pay for extras rather than unlocking them.
