Title: The sudoku I love but...
Review: 
<f>The "value before cell" option should have an option so that when you change values you can just touch the new value you want and the previous one will be replaced.
<f>Add this feature PLEASE.
<f>(Even if it is its own option) I would have given 5 stars if this option was available.

Review:

Title: Best sudoku on the net
Review: 
<a>I like everything about this version, the size (perfect on a tablet) the clarity of the numbers, the level of difficulty and the ease of use.
<f>My only quibble, a small one, is that when using the error button, it also highlights numbers just "pencilled in".
<f>I wish it would ignore them and just highlight mistakes made in numbers fully filled in.
<f>For example, you know that a number must be one of two adjacent spaces in a row, and so you pencil them in both.
<f>The error button tells you which is right and which is wrong when you might not want this information.

<p>The only reason for a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because sometimes the solution check is buggy and won't let me use it and while you can put little numbers in to show multiple spots a number can go the solution check will tell you one of you possibilities is wrong, giving away the answer for that square.
