Title: Gr8 game. But...
Review: 
<p>Few things bug me, why does the units sent in combat are not recovered (if survived) when the attack ends.
<p>Thus if we put in all units in the field, you will have to recruit new ones no matter you win or loose or even when no unit gets killed...
<o>Strange...
<o>Still a good game.

Title: Wow what I never new was true the mw1 till aw remade to 1 date
Review: 
<a>All problems with heroes are easily ignored but I want u activision to add 3 things.
<a>Resnov because he is a beast fan favorite, repair drones (cost 50,000 gold and oil to make 1, max two and heals entire base but it needs to get to the structure first) so you can fix ur base in combat, and add a mobile drone center (only one max, spawns at a max 10 combat drones each doing 30 damage range 3 rest of stats ur desire) so this game gets even better than ALL OTHER THINKING GAMES THAN ITS RIGHT NOW!
<a>(if u want 2 know real stradegy games have the rpg element allow free roam but this game understands that and I respect that).

<o>I would of rated this a 5...
<c>my tip to others with 4g error like myself is to enable wifi and connect to the game that way, once connected and your at your base, swipe down ur status bar and disable wifi and make sure mobile date is enabled.
<c>Wait 10 seconds then go back to game and problem solved, you can now enjoy game with 4g.

<o>Ok so we know games favour those who pay but this is rediculouse!
<o>My base has been levelled 13 times in 9-10 days.
<a>It is very hard to save resources as one attack would take nearly half your resources i've had 3 attacks in the past day and i have lost nearly all my resources i had been saving to upgrade my command centre but it is people who are far in the game and who have high stats being allowed to attack small players it makes it really hard to make your way through the game.
