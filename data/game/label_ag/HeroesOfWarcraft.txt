Title: Love this game, but atm too many issues
Review: 
<p>It's an awesome game, can take it everywhere with me, uses only a couple megabytes (relatively low, compared to a youtube video or soundcloud) on 3G.
<p>However, my daily challenges where all achieved, but on my phone it did not update how far along i was with my dailies, which meant i had to complete them on my computer.
<p>Also, i still dont think the look of the mobile game is perfectionised, but on the other hand it is functional.
<p>There are some bugs and issues that need to be addressed, but it's early days.

Title: Be warned
Review: 
<o>Blizzard has been known to ban player accounts without warning or explination.
<o>I had my account banned with no warning email, and when I asked them why, they refused to tell me.
<o>As far as I know I did nothing wrong, and was unable to defend myself in the matter.
<o>Again, just giving everyone a heads up.

Title: DO NOT INSTALL
Review: 
<p>I have been playing HS since it came out, and have several thousand matches under my belt.
<p>I enjoy this game, but not this unstable build.
<p>I have lost matches due to disconnects because of a phone call, and even a text.
<p>It is also slow, and lags quite often.
<p>Samsung S6 Edge.
<o>I would say play it to get your free pack of 1st patch cards, but do not play unless frustration is your game.
<o>Of course, if you don't play against real people, then I suppose it doesn't matter and install away!

<s>And to all the people crying about having to pay for naxx and black rock mountain, you don't have to pay real money.

Title: Great game (obvi), hugley unopptimised app though.
Review: 
<a>No complaints about the game itself, and the port has everthying the other versions do which is great.
<a>however, I know polish comes at a price, but unless this is made with 4k phone displays in mind it's incredibly large (most of which it won't let you move to the external mem) for a game that's essentially 2D.
<p>C'mon Card Wars is 219MB and is easliy as polished as this visually and audiably.
<p>Don't tell me card faces take up this much, I have folders of thousands of HDphotos that take up less.
