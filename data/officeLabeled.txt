Review: 
<o>This app is intended to be used with OneDrive because why would Microsoft give office for free in mobile devices when you have to pay in PC?
<o>That would obviously move everyone from the PC to the Mobile version (Free Version) Don't understand the poor ratings!

Title: Wheres the individual apps, I don't have a tablet?
Review: 
<f>Microsoft really needs to separate out Word/Excel etc, like they have done on iOS, I've switched from iOS, and can only use this for my office documents, and it doesn't allow full functionality.
