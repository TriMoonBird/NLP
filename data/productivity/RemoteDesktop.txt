Title: Mouse issue and needs resolution setting
Review: 
<>Works great and quite fast most of the time.
<>Quite easy to set up and I like the fact you can set up a gateway also.
<>One issue I'm having is that in some sessions when using a mouse, every second click of the left mouse button brings up the pan button as if you zoomed in on the screen.
<>I then have to right click to get rid of it and on it goes.
<>I haven't been able to figure out the cause of this yet but it isn't specific to a computer I connect to as the same computer sometimes doesn't experience this.
<>The last issue is there should be an option select resolution.
<>2168x1355 even on a 12" screen is tiny!

Title: Not for Beginners; Advanced Users Will Be Thrilled
Review: 
<>1st: Every credible review for this app should display the type of Android device the user is connecting with &amp; the version of Windows the user is connecting to.
<>1. I connect with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running Android Jelly Bean (4.4, KitKat), and the stylus is a key to my review.
<>2. I connect to 3 machines running Windows 7 Pro, and 1 machine running XP Pro (all at different times and in separate sessions, of course) This app is not for connecting back to your home computer while away &amp; is not compatible with any version of Windows EXCEPT those carrying the "Pro" version.
<>So, if you aren't running a Pro version of Windows on the host PC, find another app.
<>This app is not practical for use by those who: 1. Have never setup a Remote Desktop Connection before AND don't have access to assistance from some one who has 2. Those who are not savvy enough to search around Youtube or the Web to find articles on how to configure a Remote Desktop Connection &amp; how to troubleshoot problems.
<>3. Those who are not already using a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
<>For non-beginners, MS provides this free RDP app that works very well on Android devices w/screen larger than 5 inches &amp; it works well.
