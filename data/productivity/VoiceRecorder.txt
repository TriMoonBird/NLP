Title: Record calls, sing, make audiobooks.....
Review: 
<>This little recorder works great for a simple minded user like me.
<>Maybe I do not know how to use it yet, but the one bad thing is you cannot attach larger files to an email.
<>Thus you have to use a better email than Gmail, or limit files to 20 MB.
<>There are other ways, eg., Drive; Beam, etc.
<>I am sure there is a better way to send the file to a person or device, but I do not know how to use them.
<>They must be getting backed up somewhere, but I do not know where my backups go!!!!!
<>google tried to steal them from my phone company backup, and I think they may be lost in the Cloud.
<>In many States it is legal to tape any conversation that one party consents to.
<>That would be....YOU!
<>I think the Feds allow this if the State does, but I would not swear to it..
