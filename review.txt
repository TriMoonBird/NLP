Title: Does the job
Review: 
<p>The touch screen doesn't work well but luckily there is mouse pointer mode which takes a little bit to get used to but is much better then touch.
<f>I would also like to be able to zoom in more.

Title: Keyboard doesn't work right
Review: 
<p>I've run into the same issue in the Roku app.
<p>What you type is apparently not what ends up in the password field because it keeps saying you've typed the wrong password, but if you type the same password elsewhere then paste it into the field, it works.
<p>Maybe just something hinky going on with the Galazy S III.
<o>Other than that, works great.

Review:

Title: Finally a File Manager Without Network Access Needs
Review: 
<o>The developers must think we're crazy to give a simple file manager network access.
<s>Well I guess it's to download ads that are generally obnoxious.
<s>This file manager doesn't need this.
<s>Yay!
<s>They get my download and full support.
<s>The ads steal your personal info, slow the machine down and give you generally annoying content.
<s>This file manager is fast and easy and doesn't need network or internet access and doesn't download crappy ads..
<o>I give it an A+.
