Review: 
<p>Few things bug me, why does the units sent in combat are not recovered (if survived) when the attack ends.
<p>Thus if we put in all units in the field, you will have to recruit new ones no matter you win or loose or even when no unit gets killed...
<o>Strange...

Review: 
<a>All problems with heroes are easily ignored but I want u activision to add 3 things.
<a>Resnov because he is a beast fan favorite, repair drones (cost 50,000 gold and oil to make 1, max two and heals entire base but it needs to get to the structure first) so you can fix ur base in combat, and add a mobile drone center (only one max, spawns at a max 10 combat drones each doing 30 damage range 3 rest of stats ur desire) so this game gets even better than ALL OTHER THINKING GAMES THAN ITS RIGHT NOW!

<o>We want to do this as quickly as possible, and we are working as hard as we can to bring them back for everyone to use…but we can’t do that until we’ve made them secure and more stable".

Title: Cards of the Game
Review: 
<s>An awesome game that can be very fun, but it can get a bit grindy at some points if you don't want to pay for card packs.
<s>It would A LOT better if Blizzard made it so you got more than only 10 gold every 3 wins.

Review: 
<p>From my computer to my Note 10.1 to my S5 this app works with little lag!
<p>Sometimes my fingers get clumsy but only when deck building.
<p>The file is a bit big but I think it's from using a 3d engine.
<a>In terms of the game I love that the mechanics are simple and straightforward.
<a>In some ways it reminds me of when I played pokemon tcg and tried to learn yugioh...
<a>but with the visual punch that comes from the digital medium.

<s>Good game overall, only issue is its "pay to win" format all of the decks used in high ranks have 2-3 legendary cards.
<s>After playing for 2 months without spending any money, I have ZERO legendarys.
<s>Furthermore, the odds of getting the legendary I want are next to nothing.

Review: 
<p>Endless zone glitch in recent update causes you to not get plants after level 1. Also trying to exit will cause a loop that brings you back to the start of the level you were on, even if you lose, causing me to force close the app.
<p>Not sure if any other parts of the game only tried pirate seas.
<o>Note: I like how people are telling you guys about this glitch and the only thing you guys have done so far is raise the price of the dandelion.

Review: 
<s>Simply put don't download this game.
<s>You have to pay individually for each new plant after the first 6 or so.
<s>This includes more than half of the plants that you got by simply progressing through the first game.
<s>I've never been more disappointed in a sequel before as this is sheet lunacy.
<s>It would cost upwards of $75-$100 to be able top use every plant.
<s>Have not and will not ever spend a dime on this company as a result, absolutely disgusting.

Review: 
<o>I've had the app on 3 separate devices for a while.
<p>It was easy to select a number at the bottom and just touch squares to apply the number.
<p>This function is flawed now as well as the ability to remove numbers from a box when the are multiple numbers applied.
<p>Please fix.

<f>It could have better options.
<f>Doesn't describe how the points work.
<f>I lost 25 points before I figured out how the point system works.

Title: Suduko
Review: 
<f>Really love this, my only complaint is that the 'check for errors' button isn't always available (you have to win a certain amount of games first), otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable game.

Title: It was a good app, but I'm going to delete it now
Review: 
<f>This was one of the better apps for this game until it added the stupid visual effects with the numbers spinning around and getting bigger without a way to disable them.
<a>I want to challenge myself by getting the best times I can, but the visual effects are stupid, unnecessary,  and distracting.
<a>If they would allow you to disable the visual effects I'd keep the app.

Review: 
<a>1. Here's a very small user interface improvement idea for the already sparkling creative Welcome menu : the "Game Center", "Settings", "Play" and "Help" squares might preferably have "..." appended to their label because they have submenus (which doesn't apply to "Career").
<f>2. I'd also wish to have an option to set a custom label for any of my custom Sudoku's.

Title: Lots of puzzles but settings do not work
Review: 
<f>I like that there are tons of puzzles &amp; you can adjust all the settings to have as many or as little cheats as possible.
<p>I would actually give it 5 stars, but recently the "check cells", "clear cells" (to start over), and all settings in the blue &amp; red plus-sign-settings do not work.
<p>I now have 6-7 games that I royally messed up on &amp; cannot restart or ask to check for which cells are wrong.
<p>Also, I am accumulating coins but have no use for them since the settings that you spend them on do not exist.

Title: Best sudoku on the net
Review: 
<a>I like everything about this version, the size (perfect on a tablet) the clarity of the numbers, the level of difficulty and the ease of use.
<f>My only quibble, a small one, is that when using the error button, it also highlights numbers just "pencilled in".
<f>I wish it would ignore them and just highlight mistakes made in numbers fully filled in.
<f>For example, you know that a number must be one of two adjacent spaces in a row, and so you pencil them in both.
<f>The error button tells you which is right and which is wrong when you might not want this information.

Title: Good app
Review: 
<s>I love it and play it all the time, so glad it's free!
<p>The only reason for a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because sometimes the solution check is buggy and won't let me use it and while you can put little numbers in to show multiple spots a number can go the solution check will tell you one of you possibilities is wrong, giving away the answer for that square.

Review: 
<f>The game works fine.
<f>However if you exit Sudoku, game becomes a saved game.
<f>If you saved the game a while back, you may not remember that it existed.
<f>It would be nice if there was a way (like greying out the choice) to tell you that there are old games to complete before opening up a new game.
<f>Because of this, I had 5 incomplete games.
<f>UPDATE: new startup is even more clunky - I don't want to be forced to login to Google because I don't want game console features.
